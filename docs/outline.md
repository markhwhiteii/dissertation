### empirical studies

### general discussion
* list of things to cover, in no order:
    - is it mere agreement + error?
    - if so, could be indirect measure; compare with saucier & miller ras
    - difficulty in finding causal mechanism because relationship is so weak that finding an interaction making it zero is hard due to small effect
    - maybe mention don green's stuff on difficulty at 'opening the black box'?
